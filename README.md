#Understanding_GAN

This repository contains a Python notebook focused on understanding Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

The project was trained on a dataset of 8,000 images, and through this process, I gained practical insights into the roles and functioning of the Discriminator, Generator, and DataLoader components of a GAN.

Additionally, due to issues with local access to images, I created a small script to upload and access the dataset via Google Drive.
